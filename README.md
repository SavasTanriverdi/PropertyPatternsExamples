PropertyPatternsExamples

This project demonstrates the use of property patterns in C#. Property patterns are useful for matching objects based on their properties, introduced in C# 8.0 and later. This project shows how to use pattern matching to check object properties and return responses based on specific conditions.
Project Structure

The Program.cs file includes examples of:

    Custom User Greeting: Using property patterns to provide personalized greetings based on User object properties like Country and Age.
    Processing Users Based on Conditions: Using property patterns to categorize and process users based on various conditions.

Code Examples

In this project, we cover:

    Using property patterns to match specific properties within an object.
    Defining various conditions within a switch expression based on object properties.
    Returning different messages based on age, country, and other characteristics of the User object.

Example Output

    Hello Alice from the USA! You are an adult.
    Hello Bob from the USA! You are a minor.
    Hello Charlie from the UK!
    Hello David! It's great to meet someone with experience.

How to Run

    Clone the repository.
    Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
    Run the Program.cs file to see the examples of property pattern usage with different User objects.

Purpose

This project is aimed at advanced C# learners who want to understand how to use property patterns to make decisions based on object properties and handle complex conditions more concisely.
